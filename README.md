# VPC Creation and Configuration on AWS

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS, serving as a hands-on practice project during my summer training at ShapeMySkills. The goal was to build a secure and scalable network infrastructure using AWS services.

## 🛠️ **Project Objectives**
- Create a custom VPC with both public and private subnets.
- Establish connectivity using an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public access.
- Implement a NAT Gateway for secure internet access from private subnets.
- Configure Route Tables for effective traffic management.
- Set up Security Groups and Network ACLs for enhanced security.

## 🗂️ **Architecture Diagram**
You can find the architecture diagram in the **main branch**.

## ⚙️ **Components Used**
- AWS VPC
- Subnets (Public and Private)
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- NAT Gateway
- Elastic IP (EIP)
- Route Tables
- Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Security Groups

## 🚀 **Steps to Implement**
1. **Create a VPC**
    - Specify the IP address range using CIDR.
2. **Configure Subnets**
    - Create both public and private subnets within the VPC.
3. **Set Up Internet Gateway**
    - Attach an IGW to the VPC for public access.
4. **Create NAT Gateway**
    - Enable private subnets to access the internet securely.
5. **Configure Route Tables**
    - Associate appropriate route tables with public and private subnets.
6. **Set Security Policies**
    - Use Security Groups and Network ACLs to regulate traffic.

## 📥 **Prerequisites**
- AWS Account
- Basic knowledge of AWS Networking
- AWS Management Console or AWS CLI

## 🔎 **Results and Insights**
- Successfully implemented a secure and isolated network environment.
- Established effective routing and connectivity for applications.
- Gained hands-on experience in AWS networking and cloud infrastructure management.
